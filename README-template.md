## My process

First of all, I did the Desktop design. Although the mobile first methord is widely applied, my goal here is to develop sites prioritizing desktop devices.
Here I just used basic html and css because it's about a simple page, so I didn't use nothing more than the simple tools.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow  

### What I learned

I`ve developed this project to affirm myself my knowledge about the main html and css tools.
I am always pushing myself to remember and fix the basics, so I always try to do this kind of project.

### Continued development

As said before, I'll always keep doing this kind os project to improve myself and my knowledge!
